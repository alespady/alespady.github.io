<p>The way that elections are conducted in the United States allows for the possibility for a president to be elected, without winning the popular vote.  The popular vote is defined as the majority of the votes in the US.</p>


<p><strong>How is this possible?</strong></p>

<p>The way that the constitution was created, gives each state an amount of electoral votes, which is determined by the population of the state.  This was a compromise between the big states with many people, and the smaller states with fewer people.  The larger states believed that they should have more power in who became president, and the smaller states, with fewer people disagreed.  The final solution they came up with was to give each state a certain amount of electoral votes, based on their population.  This way, it would still be possible for a candidate to win if he or she won many of the smaller states.  So, the larger and smaller states could balance themselves out.  However, this can lead to the problem described before: a president can win many small states, but still not have the vote of 50%+ of Americans.</p>

<p><strong>Fixes/Ideas</strong></p>
<p>Many have suggested that the popular vote winner should be elected the president, and in fact several states, including Virginia, have signed a bill that would mandate this.  The bill is called the <a href="/EnglishResearchProject/npvic">NPVIC</a>, and has been ratified in eleven states.  However, is this the right solution for the United States?  While some voters for Al Gore in 2000 and voters for Hillary Clinton in 2016 may be upset that the popular vote candidate lost, the <a href="/EnglishResearchProject/ec">current system</a> does have its <a href="/EnglishResearchProject/ecprocon">pros and cons</a>.</p></body></html>
