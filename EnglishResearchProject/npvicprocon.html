<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>The main advantage to a popular vote to decide the President is that it would fix the issue of the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency, without needing the popular vote.  It would also fix the issue of rogue electors.  Electors do not necessarily have to vote for who the state votes for.  Using the popular vote to decide the presidency would eliminate this issue all together.  Using the national popular vote to decide the President might also encourage more people to vote when it is election time.</p>


<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>The use of the national popular vote to decide the President does come with itâ€™s setbacks.  It would lead smaller states and minorities to be upset with the choice, when the majority only accounts for around 10-20% of the country.  It would practically lead to the elimination of third parties, because with a national popular vote, there is no chance for a third party to get any sort of majority.  With the electoral college, a third party has at least a small chance to win the electoral votes of a smaller state. With the elimination of third parties, the two major parties would alienate moderates, and voters with different viewpoints.</p>
