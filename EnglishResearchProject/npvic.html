<p>According to the brief sponsored by the Congressional Research Service, the bill that X states have signed onto already called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact will make elections controlled by not the state government, or federal government, but rather a third party, non-profit organization committee.  Essentially, what the bill mandates is that states that sign must elect electors that will pledge to give their votes to the winner of the national popular vote.</p>


<p><strong>Is it legal?</strong></p>

<p>This process is legal because the Constitution leaves the election process mainly to the state.  Therefore, the states may sign onto the NPVIC without interference from the federal government.  However, the question that remains is whether or not the NPVIC would be good for the United States.</p>


<p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></p>

<p>The NPVIC does have its <a href="/EnglishResearchProject/npvicprocon">pros and cons</a> just like the <a href="/EnglishResearchProject/ec">current system</a>, and it is up to the reader to decide which system is best for the country.  It all comes down to a matter of opinion.</p>
