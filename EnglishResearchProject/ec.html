<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>To understand why we have the Electoral College, we must understand the issues that the framers of the Constitution faced.  The issue that called for the Electoral College was the decision of power between more populated states and smaller, less populated states.  Larger states with more citizens thought they should have more say in the federal government.  Smaller states viewed this as a threat, because they would have a very small influence in the pick of the President.  To solve that issue, the framers created the Electoral College.  </p>

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Essentially, the Electoral College gives each state an amount of electoral votes based on the state’s population.  We know this because Article 2 of the Constitution says that the number of electors will be equal to the “[n]umber of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress,” which is 2 + the number of members for the state in the House of Representatives.  The number of members a state gets in the House of Representatives is proportional to the state’s population.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>When electing a president, the state will have their election, in which they will vote for a candidate.  The candidate that wins in the particular state gets all of the electoral votes.  As the Constitution says, “The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President.”  The candidate with the most electoral votes wins the election.  This would solve the issue of larger states having too much power.  If a candidate won many smaller states, they can balance out the power that one larger state has.  However this can cause some problems, <a href="/EnglishResearchProject/ecprocon">as mentioned before</a>.</p></body></html>
