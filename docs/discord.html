		<h1>Discord Embedded</h1>
			<p>
			Basically, what this is is a way to get around some filters on some computers. What this does is it
			embeds the site "discordapp.com" into one package so it can be used on filtered computers.  The program
			is done by utilizing a bot called TitanEmbeds, to relay chat and to allow chat to be sent.
